title: JavaScript for Solid
---
Are you new to frontend frameworks or coming back to JavaScript after a few years? Here's a refresher on the JavaScript features and patterns you need to know. JavaScript is a flexible language and there are many approaches to writing it, so this isn't a conclusive manual for all JavaScript codebases. It's a "best practices" guide for working with Solid.

## Avoid these keywords

```js
var, this, class
```

When working with Solid, it's a good idea to avoid these. You can build any Solid app without them, they add complexity to your code, and there are replacements for them.

## `let` and `const`

You may have used `var` in JavaScript for declaring a variable. In modern JavaScript, there are two keywords for declaring variables: `let` and `const`. `const` declares a variable that won't ever be set to anything else, and `let` declares a variable that _can_ be assigned to something else.

```js
let counter = 2;
counter++; // counter is now set to 3
const badCounter = 2;
badCounter++; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

const person = { name: "Ryan" };

// This works; you haven't reassigned `person`, you simply
// mutated the object that was stored there.
person.name = "Joe";

const people = [person];

// This works; you haven't reassigned `people`, you simply added
// something to the array that was stored there.
people.push({ name: "David" });
```

When working with objects and arrays, it is far more common to use `const` than `let`, because usually you want to mutate the object (`person.name = "Joe"`) rather than reassigning the variable (`person = { name: "Joe"}`).

By default, use `const`. If you find that a variable does need to be reassigned later, change it to `let`. This makes your intention clear.

## Vite and ES6 Imports

Before modern toolchains for web development, you would "import" multiple JavaScript files by including `script` tags in our HTML.

```html title="index.html"
<script src="utils.js"></script>
<script src="main.js"></script>
```

This was tricky because `utils.js` executed first,  so it couldn't refer to functions in `main.js`. The order of the script tags mattered. You also had to declare these scripts in your HTML rather than in your JavaScript, where they were most likely to be used.

Developer tools like [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) use a better approach to importing JavaScript. Vite is a development server and a bundling tool. It provides features like automatic reloading that makes it easier to develop your project. It supports the JavaScript-based [approach to imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) that was introduced in the ES6 version of the language.

```js title="src/utils.js"
function areaOfCircle(radius) {
  return Math.PI * radius ** 2;
}

export { areaOfCircle };
```

```js title="src/main.js"
import { areaOfCircle } from "./utils.js";

console.log(areaOfCircle(4));
```

When you're ready to deploy your site, Vite "builds" your code, optimizing it and splitting your JavaScript back into script tags.

When writing Solid projects, use Vite. 

## Factory Functions and Closures

You can create a function that returns an object for reusable functionality and state.

```js
function createCar(make, year) {
  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
  const age = currentYear - year;

  return {
    make,
    age,
  };
}

const myCar = createCar("Ford Fusion", 2018);
console.log(myCar.age);
```

Because functions in JavaScript can be passed around like any other value (i.e. JavaScript has _first-class functions_), the object created by the factory function can have its own functions:

```js
function createCar(make, year) {
  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
  const age = currentYear - year;

  function drive() {
    console.log(make + " goes VROOM");
  }

  return {
    make,
    age,
    drive,
  };
}

const myCar = createCar("Ford Fusion", 2018);
myCar.drive(); //Ford Fusion goes VROOM
```

Note that the `drive` function uses the value of `make`, which was a parameter of the outer function. Later, when `myCar.drive()` is called, it "remembers" the value of `make`. This is called a _closure_ because a value outside of the function was "enclosed" with the function so that it can make use of it later on.

We can also use these ideas to write factories that directly return functions:

```js
function multiplyBy(multiplier) {
  return function (number) {
    return multiplier * number;
  };
}

const multiplicator = multiplyBy(2);
console.log(multiplicator(7)); //14
```

## Getters

The last example showed a `createCar` factory function. But what if it let you change the car's year?

```js
function createCar(make, year) {
  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
  const age = currentYear - year;

  function drive() {
    console.log(make + " goes VROOM");
  }

  function setYear(newYear) {
    year = newYear;
  }

  return {
    make,
    age,
    drive,
    setYear
  };
}

const myCar = createCar("Ford Fusion", 2018);
console.log(myCar.age); // 5
myCar.setYear(2015);
console.log(myCar.age); // 5
```

The year was updated, but the `age` wasn't. That's because the `age` calculation (`age = currentYear - year`) only happens when the `createCar` function is called. 

Instead, you can make `age` a function that calculates the `age` when it is called: 

```js
function createCar(make, year) {
  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();

  function age () {
    return currentYear - year;
  }

  function drive() {
    console.log(make + " goes VROOM");
  }

  function setYear(newYear) {
    year = newYear;
  }

  return {
    make,
    age,
    drive,
    setYear
  };
}

const myCar = createCar("Ford Fusion", 2018);
console.log(myCar.age()); // 5
myCar.setYear(2015);
console.log(myCar.age()); // 8
```

This works, but now `age` must be called as a function. Instead, we can use a [_getter_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get): 

```js
function createCar(make, year) {
  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();

  function drive() {
    console.log(make + " goes VROOM");
  }

  function setYear(newYear) {
    year = newYear;
  }

  return {
    make,
    drive,
    get age() {
      return currentYear - year;
    },
    setYear
  };
}

const myCar = createCar("Ford Fusion", 2018);
console.log(myCar.age); // 5
myCar.setYear(2015);
console.log(myCar.age); // 8
```

Now, the interface is the same as if it were a normal object property, but it calculates its value on demand.

Like any function, a getter can run any code. For example, we could `log` the number of times the property has been called:

```js 
function createCar(make, year) {
  const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();

  function drive() {
    console.log(make + " goes VROOM");
  }

  function setYear(newYear) {
    year = newYear;
  }

  let accessed = 0;
  return {
    make,
    drive,
    get age() {
      console.log(++accessed);
      return currentYear - year;
    },
    setYear
  };
}

const myCar = createCar("Ford Fusion", 2018);
myCar.age; // 1
myCar.age; // 2
myCar.age; // 3
```

You might not write many getters, but it's important to know that a property access can have "side effects", like the console log in this example.

## Destructuring

In JavaScript, it is common to pass objects around as arguments:

```js
function gameSetup(options) {
  initializeScreen(options.screenWidth, options.screenHeight);
  if (options.multiplayer) {
    startMultiplayerGame();
    return;
  }
  startGame();
}
```

If you know that these three properties (`screenWidth`, `screenHeight`, and `multiplayer`) will be present on the `options` object, we can _destructure_ it to avoid repeating the name of the object:

```js
function gameSetup(options, playersArray) {
  const { screenWidth, screenHeight, multiplayer } = options;
  initializeScreen(screenWidth, screenHeight);
  if (multiplayer) {
    console.log(
      "Starting a game with" + playersArray[0] + " and " + playersArray[1]
    );
    startTwoPlayerGame(playersArray[0], playersArray[1]);
    return;
  }
  startGame();
}
```

You can even avoid giving the object a name in the first place:
```js
function gameSetup({screenWidth, screenHight, multiplayer}, playersArray) {
  initializeScreen(screenWidth, screenHeight);
  if (multiplayer) {
   ...
```

You can also destructure arrays:

```js
function gameSetup(options, playersArray) {
  const { screenWidth, screenHeight, multiplayer } = options;
  initializeScreen(screenWidth, screenHeight);
  if (multiplayer) {
    const [player1, player2] = playersArray;
    console.log("Starting a game with" + player1 + " and " + player2);
    startTwoPlayerGame(player1, player2);
    return;
  }
  startGame();
}
```

## Template Literals

We can simplify the console output in the previous example using template literals:

```js
console.log(`Starting a game with ${player1} and ${player2}`);
```

Template literals also allow you to create multiline strings without having to manually insert a `\n` character:

```js
const multiline = `spans two
lines`;
console.log(multiline);
//spans two
//lines
```

Some tools in the Solid ecosystem make use of [tagged templates](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates) which let you define a function that operates on a template literal and any included variables. This is used to easily bring special functionality to strings. For example, using Solid without JSX makes use of an `html` tagged template:

```js
import html from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/solid-js/html";

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = ...
  ...
  return html`<div>${count}</div>`;
}

```

## Arrow Functions

There are many ways to declare a function in JavaScript. Here are most of them:

1. [Function declaration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions#the_function_declaration_function_statement)

```js
function areaOfCircle(radius) {
  return radius * Math.PI ** 2;
}
```

2. [Method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#defining_methods)

```js
const utils = {
  areaOfCircle(radius) {
    return radius * Math.PI ** 2;
  },
};
```

3. [Function expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions#the_function_expression_function_expression)

```js
const areaOfCircle = function (radius) {
  return radius * Math.PI ** 2;
};
```

4. [Arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)

```js
const areaOfCircle = (radius) => {
  return radius * Math.PI ** 2;
};

// Or the shorthand if you only have one line of code in the function body:
const areaOfCircle = (radius) => radius * Math.PI ** 2;
```

There are nuanced differences between these declarations, but they are irrelevant for day-to-day working with Solid (if you're curious, check out this [detailed article](https://dmitripavlutin.com/differences-between-arrow-and-regular-functions/)).

If you're in doubt, use an arrow function (example #4). As long as you're not using the `this` keyword, there will be no difference between an arrow function and a function expression.


## Functions as Arguments

Earlier, we saw how you can return a function from a function. You can also accept a function as an argument to a function:

```js
function callForEach(array, func) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    const currentElement = array[i];
    func(currentElement);
  }
}

const myArray = ["I", "love", "Solid"];
callForEach(myArray, console.log);
// I
// love
// Solid
```

Many functions that are built in to JavaScript (and many that come with Solid) take a function argument. The above functionality can be found as `.forEach` on JavaScript arrays:

```js
const myArray = ["I", "love", "Solid"];
myArray.forEach(console.log);
// I
// love
// Solid
```

Another common example is the built-in `map` method. It takes as its argument a function that maps the current element of the array to a new result:

```js
const myArray = ["I", "love", "Solid"];
const uppercase = myArray.map(element => element.toUpperCase()) // ["I", "LOVE", "SOLID"]
```

## Declarative vs Imperative Code

JavaScript array methods like `map` (and others like [`reduce`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) and [`filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)) can replace loops that you might make with `for` or `while`. Those traditional loop techniques are "imperative". They state step-by-step how to accomplish something:

```js
const myNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 18, 65];
let oddNumbers = [];
for (const number of myNumbers) {
  if (number % 2 !== 0) {
    oddNumbers.push(number);
  }
}
console.log(oddNumbers); // [ 1, 3, 5, 11, 65 ]
```

Using JavaScript array methods allow for more "declarative" code, where you state _what_ to do but not the full details of _how_.

```js
const myNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 18, 65];
const oddNumbers = myNumbers.filter((number) => number % 2 !== 0);
console.log(oddNumbers); // [ 1, 3, 5, 11, 65 ]
```

The `filter` array method accomplished the same result in one line of code. It take a function and returns a new array that contains only the elements that return true when passed to the function.

"Declarative" code makes use of abstractions to write streamlined code, focused more on _what_ to accomplish _how_. Using `filter` allows you to write less "boilerplate" looping code, and instead focus on the core functionality. The code is more descriptive, too. `for` loops can be used for all sorts of purposes, but whenever you see `filter` you know that the purpose of the looping is to ignore some items in an array.

HTML is a great example of a _declarative_ way of writing: you state _what_ you want the structure to be, not _how_ it should be put together or rendered. Similarly, makes it easier to write declarative code when working with interactive user interfaces.
