##What is Tracking?

Communication between **primitives** is vital to Solid’s functionality and efficiency 
versus other JavaScript Frameworks. Without **tracking**, solid’s primitives would 
not be able to communicate with each other. For example, a **signal** must 
be updated for an **effect** to execute. How does the effect know when the 
signal has been updated? 

Imagine, if you will, an air-traffic controller. 
They must keep a detailed log of flights: when/where they land, take off, etc. Based on 
that log, they communicate with the flights. Now, imagine instead of flights, 
we’re talking about signals. Tracking keeps a log of changes in a signal and 
communicates them to effects. Then, the effect knows to execute.

Tracking enables a signal and an effect to share a relationship. That relationship 
is called a Publisher/Subscriber pattern. The **publisher** (signal) communicates 
to the **subscriber** (effect). When a signal’s updating triggers an effect, it can 
be said that the effect is “subscribed” or a “subscriber” to the signal. When an 
effect is subscribed to an effect, that subscription is “tracked.”


```jsx
function ToggleElement() 
  const [showElement, setShowElement] = createSignal(true);

  createEffect(() => {
    if (showElement()) {
      console.log('Element is visible');
      // Perform some side effect when the element is visible
    } else {
      console.log('Element is hidden');
      // Perform some side effect when the element is hidden
    }
  
  });

In this example, the created effect is subscribed to the showElement signal. If the showElement 
signal is changed, the change will be tracked and the effect function will automatically trigger. 
This is an example of automatic dependency tracking.
